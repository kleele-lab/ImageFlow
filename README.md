# Kleele Lab Rotation Analysis Pipeline Tool

## will have an abstract here (requested by michael)

## Description
This toolkit tries to make it easier to connect different biological analysis tools to automate your pipelines! It currently doesn't support too much, however, it can run:
- Channel separation (slice a multi channel image into separate images)
- Ilastik Pixel Classifiers (generate probability maps or segmentations using trained Ilastik classifiers)
- Cell Profiler pipelines ()
- [in progress] Fiji Macros

Warnings:
- Code must be run from inside the Kleele 2 server in a directory that has access to all of your resources
